# Restaurant Management System👨‍🍳🍴
Many restaurant managers and employees suffer from paperwork because it is a heavy, inaccurate, and complex job, so our goal in this project is to develop a restaurant management system that collects data and improves employee performance, by recording each order precisely in this system so managers can easily manage and collect required data.
