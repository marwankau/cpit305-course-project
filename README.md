# Restaurant Management System👨‍🍳🍴
Many restaurant managers and employees suffer from paperwork because it is a heavy, inaccurate, and complex job, so our goal in this project is to develop a restaurant management system that collects data and improves employee performance, by recording each order precisely in this system so managers can easily manage and collect required data.

## in Detail:
First of all, in our system, we will start by creating restaurant data such as restaurant owner,  employees, managers, menu, and branches. Each branch has several employees and a manager.

* ### Owner:
The owner is responsible for several features such as managing all branches' . 
* ### Manger
Each manager can access the data belonging to the branch that he manages and can use serval functions such as calculating monthly revenue, collecting data about the best seller order, and collecting data about the fewer seller orders in the menu.
* ### Employee
Each employee also can access the system to add, update, and cancel an order.
